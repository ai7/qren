========
Overview
========

- Display detailed information about Doom/Doom2/Heretic LMPs.
- Set LMP file version so it works with different version of the game.
- Change the recording player for Doom/Doom2 multi-player LMPs.
- Convert 1.0 - 1.2 LMP to the new LMP format used with Doom 1.4 - 1.9.
- Remove a particular section of the LMP based on seconds or gametics.
- Append some idle tics at the end of LMP so you can see the score longer.
- Chop some gametics from the end of file.
- Remove all pauses in the LMP, that actually works!
- LMP file modified or created will retain it's original file date & time.

============
Installation
============

1) Make a directory and copy all lmputil files to it.
2) add the directory to your path statement in autoexec.bat

If you are using 4dos/Ndos, than create an alias that points to
lmputil.exe instead of add the directory to your path.

==========
What's New
==========

The RemovePause command is implemented. I was rather disappointed by the way
other utility removes pauses in the LMP. Some program keeps the PauseStart
gametic with the pause removed, and remove the PauseEnd gametic completely,
while others did the other way around. It didn't work for a lot of LMPs.

They also get confused if there are more than 1 pauses during a particular
gametics, which certainly is possible and does occur in multiplayer LMPs.
The result is the LMP get's completely out of sync during playback. Some
program would also leave a unbalanced pause in the LMP, and have trouble
with LMPs that contains incomplete gametics, which happens if Doom run out
of demo memory.

LmpUtil handles all of the above situations correctly. Rest assured, that if
a LMP doesn't playback correctly after LmpUtil removes the pause, then it's
simply not possible to remove the pauses without affecting the game. Read
the LmpUtil.FAQ for more information about the -rp command.

============
Sample Usage
============

To display information about a LMP, simply type :

-> lmputil lmpfile

Change the recording player to the next available player :

-> lmputil -viewer lmpfile

Change the LMP file version to 1.9 :

-> lmputil -ver 1.9 lmpfile

You can combine -viewer and -ver. For example :

-> lmputil lmpfile -ver 1.7 -viewer

will set the LMP version to 1.7, and change the recording player.

Since LmpUtil v2.0, wildcards support is added for -ver and -viewer. Say you
want to convert all the LMPs in your current directory to 1.9, the command
to do it is :

-> lmputil -ver 1.9 *.lmp

To convert a 1.1 or 1.2 LMP to the newer LMP format, type :

-> lmputil -convert source target <optional version>

The source and target must not be the same file. Although the program tries
to detect if the 2 files are the same, it will fail if you deliberately
tries to fool it. And in that case, will corrucpt the source file.  If
version is not specified, the target file will be 1.9.

Although the order of parameter doesn't matter, i.e., you can specify the
lmpfile either before or after the -viewer, there must be a version number
follow -ver; a source, a target, and a optional version after -convert.

So you cannot, for example, do :

-> lmputil -viewer -ver lmpfile 1.6

because a lmp version is expected after -ver.

To add 100 seconds of waiting time at the end of your LMP, do :

-> lmputil -sec -wait 100 source.lmp target.lmp

To remove the first 10 minutes of LMP, do :

-> lmputil -cut 1 21000 source.lmp target.lmp

the 21000 represents 10 minutes, just remember that 35 gametics is 1 second.

The program expect time to be specified in gametics, not seconds, unless the
-sec parameter is present. To convert from time to gametics, do:

1) convert the time to seconds
2) multiply the seconds by 35.

You can use either - or / as the parameter indicator. All of the above
examples can be done with / instead of -. So you can do, for example,

-> lmputil /ver 1.6 lmpfile -viewer

If -convert, -cut, -wait, -chop, & -rp is specified, anything after the
required parameter(s) will be ignored. So if you need to use you use
-heretic and/or -sec, use it before the -cut.

You can safely omit the .lmp extension in almost all cases and the program
will find the right file.
